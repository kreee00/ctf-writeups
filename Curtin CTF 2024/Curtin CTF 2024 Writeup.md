Did a LOT of research and digging. The distance at first I got it wrong but thankfully found the correct answer from this link >> https://airport.globefeed.com/Distance_Between_Airports_Result.asp?from=DPS&to=BDO . The name of PIC is just a basic Google Search. and Lastly the part number of Terrain Awareness and Alerting System PK-LKS Boeing 737-800 i got it from this accident report >> https://asn.flightsafety.org/reports/2013/20130413_B738_PK-LKS.pdf .
